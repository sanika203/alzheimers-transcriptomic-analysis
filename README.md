# Exploratory Transcriptomic Analysis of Alzheimer’s Disease

This repository contains an exploratory differential gene expression analysis of Alzheimer’s disease using publicly available microarray data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).

## Dataset
- GEO accession: GSE44770
- Tissue: Human prefrontal cortex
- Sample type: Pooled Alzheimer’s disease and non-demented control samples
- Platform: Microarray-based transcriptomic profiling

## Objective
To identify broad patterns of gene expression changes associated with Alzheimer’s disease by comparing RNA expression levels between disease and control brain samples.

## Methods
- Gene expression data were analyzed using Python in Google Colab
- Mean expression values were calculated for Alzheimer’s disease and control groups
- Log2 fold change was used to assess relative upregulation and downregulation of genes
- Visualization was performed using matplotlib

## Key Findings
- Immune and inflammation-related genes were upregulated in Alzheimer’s disease samples
- Mitochondrial and energy metabolism genes were downregulated in Alzheimer’s disease samples
- Results are consistent with neuroinflammation and metabolic dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease

## Notes
This analysis is exploratory in nature and based on pooled samples. As a result, statistical inference was not performed, and findings should be interpreted as broad transcriptomic trends rather than definitive biomarkers.
